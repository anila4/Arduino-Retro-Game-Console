The following is a custom console I've designed using an Arduino Uno that communicates with an 8x8 LED matrix display using SPI protocol. The games are controlled and played using a set of 4 push buttons, serving as 
up, down, left, and right buttons. Due to a lack of available push buttons (that are being used in other projects of mine) combined with my classes, some functions are limited. I intend to develop this project (and
give it a proper shell/casing) once I have access to more push buttons and can add more functions to the console. 

Have fun with it, and make something you're proud of.

Note: No external libraries were use making this project, which I would recommend doing if you're trying to learn while doing these projects. However, if you just want this done fast and easy, I'd recommend some libraries
for the LED matrix control (easier to understand the initializing and display logic).
